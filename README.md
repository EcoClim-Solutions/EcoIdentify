# Classifying Recycling Material

This project is built by EcoClim Solutions. It involves classifying waste according to how it's handled or processed, which is crucial for recycling as some materials are recyclable and others are not.

## Objective

The objective of this notebook is to build a model that helps to classify recycling material, essentially solving a multi-class single-label classification problem.

## Dataset

The dataset used is an altered version of a dataset found on Kaggle. It contains images of six different classes of waste materials: Paper, Cardboard, Plastic, Glass, Metal, and Trash. The dataset is imbalanced, with each class having a different number of images. Some images in the dataset are mislabeled, and all images are taken with a white background.

## Dependencies

The project is implemented using TensorFlow and other Python libraries. Google Colab is used as the development environment.

## Usage

Please do not copy any/all parts of this code without direct permissions from the official company.

## Future Work

Improvements can be made in the quality of images in the dataset. Also, the precision of the model can be improved by using a more balanced dataset and by correcting the mislabeled data.
